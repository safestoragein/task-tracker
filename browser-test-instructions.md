# Manual Testing Instructions for Team Management & Settings

## Steps to Test:

1. **Open the application**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Look for Auth Debug panel** in bottom-right corner (black box with white text)
3. **Login Process**:
   - Use any of these admin emails: `ramesh@safestorage.in`, `kushal@safestorage.in`, `kiran@safestorage.in`
   - Click Login button
4. **Check Auth Debug panel** after login - should show:
   - Loading: ❌
   - Authenticated: ✅  
   - User ID: (should have a number)
   - User Name: (should show name)
   - User Role: admin
5. **Test Team Tab**:
   - Click "Team" tab
   - If working: Should show "Team Management" heading and "Add Member" button
   - If broken: Will show "Access Restricted" message
6. **Test Settings Tab**:
   - Click "Settings" tab  
   - Should show "Settings" heading and various setting categories

## Expected Results:
- Admin users should see Team Management interface
- All users should see Settings interface

## If Issues Found:

2. Check Network tab for failed API requests
3. Note what Auth Debug panel shows
4. Try different admin email addresses

## Current Status:
